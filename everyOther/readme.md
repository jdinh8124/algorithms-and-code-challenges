## Every Other 

- Given a string str containing only the characters x and y, change it into a string such that there are no matching adjacent characters. You’re allowed to delete zero or more characters in the string. Find the minimum number of required deletions.

```
$ everyOther(‘xxyxxy’)
$ 2 // str becomes ‘xyxy’

```
