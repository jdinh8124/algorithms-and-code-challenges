# ClassifyStrings CodeSignal Interview Question

## Instructions
- You categorize strings into three types: good, bad, or mixed. If a string has 3 consecutive vowels or 5 consecutive consonants, or both, then it is categorized as bad. Otherwise it is categorized as good. Vowels in the English alphabet are ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"] and all other letters are consonants.

- The string can also contain the character ?, which can be replaced by either a vowel or a consonant. This means that the string "?aa" can be bad if ? is a vowel or good if it is a consonant. This kind of string is categorized as mixed.

- Implement a function that takes a string s and returns its category: good, bad, or mixed.

## Examples

```


Example

For s = "aeu", the output should be
classifyStrings(s) = "bad";

For s = "a?u", the output should be
classifyStrings(s) = "mixed";

For s = "aba", the output should be
classifyStrings(s) = "good".
